# SqlPractice_PostgreSQL
Solving the problems in the book "SQL Practice Problems" by Sylvia Moestl Vasilik, using different techniques in PostgreSQL.

If you own the book and can think of another solution to solve any of its problems, please feel free to contribute!

A convenient way to test solutions is `psql -f [solution].sql [dbname]`, e.g., `psql -f 1.sql SQLPracticeProblems`.
